This document specifies the CORBA Object Model and uses concepts from
that model to define the operation of the Object Request Broker (ORB).
The ORB is the basic mechanism by which objects transparently make
requests to - and receive responses from - each other on the same
machine or across a network. A client need not be aware of the
mechanisms used to communicate with or activate an object, how the
object is implemented, or where the object is located.
