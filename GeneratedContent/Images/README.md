`GeneratedContent/` is a folder to hold .tex files generated from models defined in external modeling tools.  Manually editing files in this directory is a bad idea.  The subfolder `Images/` is for, obviously, images generated from the models, preferably .svg format. Manually created image files should go in the top level `Images/` directory. Nothing within this directory should be considered persistent, only to be regenerated from the model on demand.
