The minimum required for a CORBA-compliant system is adherence to the
specifications in this standard and one mapping. Each additional
language mapping is a separate, optional compliance point. Optional
means users aren't required to implement these points if they are
unnecessary at their site, but if implemented, they must adhere to the
CORBA specifications to be called CORBA-compliant. For instance, if a
vendor supports C++, their ORB must comply with the OMG IDL to C++
binding specified in the C++ Language Mapping Specification.

The CORBA Language Mappings have been separated from this standard and
each language mapping is its own separate OMG specification. Please
refer to \url{http://www.omg.org/spec/} for these specifications.
